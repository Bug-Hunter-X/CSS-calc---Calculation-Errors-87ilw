This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to operator precedence and unit inconsistencies.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version. The issue highlights the importance of understanding operator precedence and ensuring consistent units within `calc()` expressions.  Nesting `calc()` expressions requires careful attention to parenthesis balancing.
