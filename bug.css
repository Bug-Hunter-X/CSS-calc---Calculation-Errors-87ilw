The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you don't carefully consider operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because you're trying to subtract a dimensionless number from a percentage.  Another common issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions; ensure that parentheses are correctly balanced to avoid calculation errors.
